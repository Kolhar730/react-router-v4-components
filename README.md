# React-Router-v4-Components

This repository has the source for 2 Basic React Components powered by [React Router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom).

Both my examples are very similar and are built around the same data, that is of Premier League Clubs.

There are 2 Components:

1. A Simple React Router v4 Component. (Just barebones html components and minimal css).
2. A Simple React Router v4 Component built with MDC Top App Bar and Drawer. (Check out [MDC](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-react))

The demo's of the 2 components can be seen here:

1. A Simple React Router v4 Component. [Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Kolhar730/react-router-v4-simple-and-mdc/tree/master/simple-react-router-v4)
2. A Simple React Router v4 Component built with MDC Top App Bar and Drawer. [Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/8nrz8o6x00)

Please be sure to leave any comments/suggestions you have for me in the Issues section/PR section.
PR's are always welcome. And I'd love to know if they were helpful to any of you.

Thanks!
